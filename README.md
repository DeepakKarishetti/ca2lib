Ca2Lib is an open-source `LiDAR-Camera[RGB]` calibration toolbox.

# ðŸš€ Usage

To calibrate your camera(s), first generate a [target configuration file](todo), gather your sensors/bag and run:
```bash
rosrun ca2lib stereo_recorder \
    -l <topic_camera_left> \
    -r <topic_camera_right> \
    -t <target.yaml> \
    -o <output folder>
```

After enough views of the calibration target are acquired, run the calibration

```bash
rosrun ca2lib calibrate_camera \
    -i <images folder> \
    -t <target.yaml> \
    -o <cam_results.yaml>
```

Onto the extrinsics!

To calibrate the LiDAR relative pose, follow the calibration guide [Link Soon]() and run the following node

```bash
rosrun ca2lib calibrate_lidar_camera \
    -c <camera_topic> \
    -i <cam_intrinsics.yaml> \
    -l <cloud_topic> \
    -t <target.yaml> \
    -o <lidar_in_cam.yaml>
```

Finally, visualize your setup reprojections:

```bash
rosrun ca2lib visualize_lidar_in_camera \
    -c <camera_topic> \
    -i <cam_intrinsics.yaml> \
    -l <cloud_topic>
    -e <lidar_in_cam.yaml>
```

# ðŸ‘· Setup

We suggest running `ca2lib` using Docker. Simply `cd` into the repository and build the Docker image:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rvp-group/ca2lib.git
cd ca2lib
./docker/build.sh
```

To finally start a container, simply:

```bash
./docker/run.sh <DATA-DIR>
```

## Build from source

Assuming you already have ROS Noetic installed (if not, refer to [this guide](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation)), install the requirements:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
    libspdlog-dev
```

Clone the repository inside your catkin workspace and build the package.

```bash
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:rvp-group/ca2lib.git
cd ..
catkin build ca2lib
```
